# Maze Generator and Solver

This project is a maze generator and solver implemented using graph theory in C++. It can create random mazes and find the solution path from the start to the end of the maze.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Creates random mazes using graph-based algorithms like bfs, dfs, a*.
- **Maze Solving:** Finds and displays the solution path from the start to the end of the maze.
- **Visualization:** Provides a visual representation of the generated maze and the solution path.

## Technologies Used

- **C++:** Core programming language used for implementing the maze generation and solving algorithms.
- **Graph Theory:** Utilized for maze generation and pathfinding.
